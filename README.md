# Heroes
This is my playground as I learn Angular.

Why I dedcided to learn Angular over React or Vue:
Vue.js is still new and did not seem very apealing to me on the few instances I needed to work with it.
I initially wanted to go with ReactJS, which has a similar feel and reputation as Angular, but then I found out it was created by Facebook...
Angular on the other hand was started by Google, is a (more) complete solution and obeys the MVC modell, which I embrace. Also its build on TypeScript which is poses another challenge to me, as a JavaScript kid.

All three would be a viable choice to learn, but at the end, I stuck with Angular.

I am created this App by following the beginner tutorial on angular.io:
